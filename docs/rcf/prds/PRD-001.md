# PRD-001: Zero-Cost Remote Job Search Automation System

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2026-02-08

---

## Executive Summary

An intelligent, locally-hosted automation system that discovers remote jobs across multiple platforms, provides AI-powered matching and gap analysis, generates tailored application materials, and tracks the full application lifecycle. Zero infrastructure cost with privacy-first architecture.

---

## Problem Statement

Remote job seekers waste 15-20 hours/week manually searching across fragmented platforms, resulting in:
- 80% of relevant jobs being missed
- 2-5% response rates from generic applications
- 30% of applications lost due to poor tracking

Cloud solutions cost $136/month, making them inaccessible for cost-conscious seekers.
