Zero infrastructure cost with privacy-first architecture.",
  "problemStatement": "Remote job seekers waste 15-20 hours/week manually searching across fragmented platforms, resulting in 80% of relevant jobs being missed, 2-5% response rates from generic applications, and 30% of applications lost due to poor tracking.
