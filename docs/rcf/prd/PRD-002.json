  "executiveSummary": "The LinkedIn Integration & Advanced Features product extends the Core Job Assistant MVP (PRD-001) with specialized LinkedIn job scraping capabilities and advanced user features. LinkedIn represents the primary job source for remote workers, but accessing this data requires sophisticated stealth techniques to avoid detection by LinkedIn's anti-scraping systems. This product implements browser fingerprint injection, human-like behavior simulation, session management, and real-time detection monitoring to safely extract job listings while providing fallback methods when scraping becomes too risky. The LinkedIn integration is inherently high-risk due to the platform's aggressive anti-bot measures, requiring constant adaptation and monitoring to maintain functionality. Beyond LinkedIn integration, this product introduces power-user features including comprehensive analytics dashboards, automated email reporting, and enhanced application tracking capabilities. Users gain visibility into their job search performance through detailed statistics, success rate analysis, and trend visualization. The analytics system generates daily job digests and weekly performance summaries delivered via email, helping users optimize their job search strategy. Advanced UI features like application notes, timeline visualization, and cover letter refinement tools provide a more sophisticated user experience for serious job seekers. Performance optimization ensures the system meets strict latency requirements across all features, from job scraping completion times to dashboard responsiveness. Health monitoring and centralized error logging provide operational visibility, while comprehensive documentation covers memory budgeting and legal considerations around LinkedIn data extraction.",
  "problemStatement": "Remote job seekers heavily rely on LinkedIn for job opportunities, but the platform's anti-scraping measures make automated job collection extremely challenging and risky.
