    "executiveSummary": "The Project Opportunity Assistant is an AI-powered freelance project discovery and proposal management system designed specifically for solo entrepreneurs and JavaScript/TypeScript developers seeking remote project-based work. The system addresses the critical inefficiency where freelancers waste 10+ hours weekly manually browsing fragmented platforms, writing repetitive proposals, and missing 70% of relevant opportunities due to timing and platform fragmentation. By providing intelligent project-candidate matching, AI-powered proposal generation, and competitive pricing intelligence, the system transforms the freelance opportunity discovery process from a time-consuming manual task into an efficient, data-driven workflow.\n\nThe system operates through a comprehensive project pipeline that begins with manual project input from major freelance platforms (Upwork, Freelancer.com, Contra, Fiverr Pro, PeoplePerHour, Guru.com) and progresses through intelligent matching, proposal generation, and bid tracking. The matching algorithm uses project-specific weights emphasizing skill overlap (35%), budget alignment (25%), and project complexity matching (20%), while the proposal generation system creates both short (200-400 words) and detailed proposals with multiple variants tailored to different client preferences. The pricing intelligence system provides three tiers of guidance, from simple budget-based suggestions to advanced win/loss analytics that learn optimal pricing strategies over time.\n\nTargeting JavaScript/TypeScript developers from South Asia who face geographic restrictions on many platforms, the system prioritizes freelance platforms with global accessibility and high technical project volume. The solution serves solo AI-powered entrepreneurs who leverage AI tools for service delivery, technical consultants seeking contract opportunities, and full-stack developers pursuing both employment and freelance work simultaneously. The system maintains complete user privacy through local deployment while providing enterprise-level functionality for individual professionals.\n\nArchitecturally, the Project Opportunity Assistant operates as an independent system within a multi-PRD ecosystem, sharing infrastructure with the Core Job Assistant (PRD-001) while maintaining separate business logic and data pipelines. Built on the same loosely-coupled plugin architecture using Ports and Adapters pattern, the system supports future expansion to automated scraping, social media monitoring, and integration with a standalone Proposal Builder MCP service. This foundation ensures zero infrastructure costs, complete data privacy, and seamless scalability as the freelance opportunity landscape evolves.",
